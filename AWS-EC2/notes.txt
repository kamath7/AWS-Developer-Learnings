EC2 Notes

Elastic Compute Cloud - EC2

- Secure resizable Compute capacity in the cloud. Like a VM only hosted in AWS instead of own DC. 
- Designed to make web scale cloud computing easier
- Capacity you want when you need it 
- Complete control of instances. Instances -> VMs 

EC2 - Pay only for what you use. (Pay as you go model)
No wasted capacity in EC2. Grow and shrink when you need 

Cloud - Servers up and running within minutes instead of months (On-premise)


EC2 pricing options 

a) On Demand - Pay by the hour or the second depending on type of instance you run 
b) Reserved - Reserved capacity for one or three years. Upto 72%  discount on hourly charge
c) Spot - Purchase unused capacity at discount of up to 90% . Prices fluctuate with suppy and demand 
d) Dedicated - Physical EC2 server dedicated for your use. Most expensive option 

On Demand 
- Flexible. Low cost and flexibility of EC2 without any up-front payment 
- Short-Tem . Application with short term / unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted
- Testing the water - applications being developed on EC2 for the first time 

Reserved 

- Predictable usage applications (steady state)
- Application that require reserved capacity
- Pay up front. Can make up-front payments. Discounts advantage
- Standard RIs - upto 72% off on-demand price 
- Convertible RIs - Upto 54% discount. Option to change to different RI type of equal or greater value (t3 large to t3 xl)
- Scheduled RIs - Launch within time window you define. match capcaity reservation to predictable recurring schedule that only requires a fraction of day, week or month 

RI- Reserved Instance
RIs operate at a regional level 

Spot Instances (SI)
- Applications that have flexible start and end time 
- Applications that are only feasible at very low compute time 
- Users with urgent need for large amounts of additional computing capacity
- Workloads -> Image rendering, Genomic Sequencing, Algorithmic Trading 

SIs great for 
- Compliance - Regulatory requirement that may not support multi tenant virtualisation
- Licensing - Great for licnesing which does not support multi tenancy or cloud deployments 
- On demand - Cna be purchased on demand(hourly)
- Reserved - can be purchased as a reservation for upto 70% off the on-demand price 

Savings plans -
- Save upto 72% - All aws compute usage regardless of instance type or regional
- Commit to 1 or 3 years - Commit to use specific amount of compute power for 1 yr or 3 yr period. compute power measured in $/hour
- Super flexible - not only ec2. includes serverless -> lambda

Different types of EC2 instances 

Instance types mean the following 
- Hardware - hardware of the host computer used 
- Capabilities - Each instance type offers different compute, memory and storage capabilities and are grouped in instance families 
- Application Requirements - Select instnace type based on requirements of application that you plan to run on instance 

Micro instance - low traffic websites 
FPGA - Field Programmable Gate Array - Applications which need massive parallel programming power. Financial fields, Genomics - applications
