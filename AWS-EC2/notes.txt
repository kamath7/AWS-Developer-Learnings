EC2 Notes

Elastic Compute Cloud - EC2

- Secure resizable Compute capacity in the cloud. Like a VM only hosted in AWS instead of own DC. 
- Designed to make web scale cloud computing easier
- Capacity you want when you need it 
- Complete control of instances. Instances -> VMs 

EC2 - Pay only for what you use. (Pay as you go model)
No wasted capacity in EC2. Grow and shrink when you need 

Cloud - Servers up and running within minutes instead of months (On-premise)
