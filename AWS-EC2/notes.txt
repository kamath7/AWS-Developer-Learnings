EC2 Notes

Elastic Compute Cloud - EC2

- Secure resizable Compute capacity in the cloud. Like a VM only hosted in AWS instead of own DC. 
- Designed to make web scale cloud computing easier
- Capacity you want when you need it 
- Complete control of instances. Instances -> VMs 

EC2 - Pay only for what you use. (Pay as you go model)
No wasted capacity in EC2. Grow and shrink when you need 

Cloud - Servers up and running within minutes instead of months (On-premise)


EC2 pricing options 

a) On Demand - Pay by the hour or the second depending on type of instance you run 
b) Reserved - Reserved capacity for one or three years. Upto 72%  discount on hourly charge
c) Spot - Purchase unused capacity at discount of up to 90% . Prices fluctuate with suppy and demand 
d) Dedicated - Physical EC2 server dedicated for your use. Most expensive option 

On Demand 
- Flexible. Low cost and flexibility of EC2 without any up-front payment 
- Short-Tem . Application with short term / unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted
- Testing the water - applications being developed on EC2 for the first time 

Reserved 

- Predictable usage applications (steady state)
- Application that require reserved capacity
- Pay up front. Can make up-front payments. Discounts advantage
- Standard RIs - upto 72% off on-demand price 
- Convertible RIs - Upto 54% discount. Option to change to different RI type of equal or greater value (t3 large to t3 xl)
- Scheduled RIs - Launch within time window you define. match capcaity reservation to predictable recurring schedule that only requires a fraction of day, week or month 

RI- Reserved Instance
RIs operate at a regional level 

Spot Instances (SI)
- Applications that have flexible start and end time 
- Applications that are only feasible at very low compute time 
- Users with urgent need for large amounts of additional computing capacity
- Workloads -> Image rendering, Genomic Sequencing, Algorithmic Trading 

SIs great for 
- Compliance - Regulatory requirement that may not support multi tenant virtualisation
- Licensing - Great for licnesing which does not support multi tenancy or cloud deployments 
- On demand - Cna be purchased on demand(hourly)
- Reserved - can be purchased as a reservation for upto 70% off the on-demand price 

Savings plans -
- Save upto 72% - All aws compute usage regardless of instance type or regional
- Commit to 1 or 3 years - Commit to use specific amount of compute power for 1 yr or 3 yr period. compute power measured in $/hour
- Super flexible - not only ec2. includes serverless -> lambda

Different types of EC2 instances 

Instance types mean the following 
- Hardware - hardware of the host computer used 
- Capabilities - Each instance type offers different compute, memory and storage capabilities and are grouped in instance families 
- Application Requirements - Select instnace type based on requirements of application that you plan to run on instance 

Micro instance - low traffic websites 
FPGA - Field Programmable Gate Array - Applications which need massive parallel programming power. Financial fields, Genomics - applications 

On Mac important note- download the .pem file. run -> chmod 400 *pem file name* -> Once done - ssh ec2-user@*public ipv4 address*
For windows convert .pem to ppk

EBS Volumes
Elastic Block Store - EBS 
-Storage volumes that you can attach to EC2 instances - use them as you wish 
- Can use EBS to run a db 
- Run an OS 
- store data / applications

EBS designed for 
- Mission critical workloads. Highly available (auto replicated within a single AZ to protect against HW failures)
- EBS volumes are also highly scalable (can change capacity and volume type without any downtime)

Different types of EBS volumes 

- General Purpose SSD (gp2)
- Balance of price and performance
- 3IOPS per gib upto max of 16000 IOPS per volumes
- good for boot volumes or develipment which are not latency sensitive 

Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1)
- High performance option and most expensive 
- upto 64000 IOPS per vol. 50 iops per gib 
- If 16000 IOPS is needed 
- designed for IO intensive apps such as DBs 

Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2)
- Latest gen 
- Higher durability and more iops 
-io2 has the same price as io1 
- IO2 has 500 IOPS per GIB. Upto 64000 IOPS. 99.999% durability instead of 99.9%
- Suitable for IO intensive and latency sensitive workloads. Large DBs. Also  apps that require higher durability

Throughput optimised HDD (st1)
- Low cost HDD vol 
- Baseline Throughput of 40MB/s per TB
- Ability to burst upto 250MB/s per TB 
- Max Throughput of 500 MB/sper vol 
- Frequently accessed, Throughput intensive workloads (big Data, Data Warehouses, Log Processing)

Cold HDD (sc1) 
- Lowest cost option 
- Baseline Throughput - 12 MB/s per TB 
- Ability to burst - upto 80 MB/s per TB 
- max Throughput - 250Mb/s per vol 
- good choice for colder data requiring fewer scans per day 
- good for apps that need lowest cost and performance is not a factor 
- cannot be a boot vol 

IOPs vs Throughput 

IOPS 
- Measues number of read and write operations per sec 
- Important metric for quick transactions, low latency apps, transactional workloads. (ex. DB ops )
- Ability to action readsand writes very quickly
- Choose provisioned IOPS SSD (io1 or io2)

Throughput 
- Measures number of bits read or written per second (MB/s)
- Important metric for large dataset, large IO sizes, complex queries. (Algorithmic Financial Trading)
- Ability to deal with large datasets
- choose Throughput optimised HDD (st1)
