KMS

- Key Management Service 
- Managed service that makes it easy to create and control encryption keys used to encrypt data 
- completely integrated with many aws services. seamless integration 
- simple to encrypt data with encryption keys 
- When to use - Whenever sensitive data is used. e.x. - financial data, customer data, db passwords, credentials
- some aws services with kms - s3, rds, dynamodb, lambda, EBS, cloudtrail(can get audit trail)

CMK 
- Custoemr Master Key 
- Capable of encrypting and decrypting data upto 4KB 
- used for generating, encrypting and decrypting data key 
- data key then used to encrypt/decrypt data 
- Envelope encryption

- Can refers to alias when using cmk 
- date and time when cmk was created 
- can add own descriptio to describe cmk 
- key state - enabled, disabled, pending deletion, unavailable
- key material - customer-provided or aws-provided
- can never be exported 

Envelope Encryption 

- Process for encrypting data. applies to files > 4KB 
- Process - Use generateDataKey API which will create data key (envelope key) which is used to encrypt data. Stored locally with the data to be used for decryption later 
- KMS decrytion process - encrypted data (data key) with data/ AWS Kms decryptes in plain text form
- Why EE? - encrypt data directly with kms leads to using of network, with EE only data key goes over network not data. Data key used locally in app or aws service avoids the need to transfer large amount of data to KMS
