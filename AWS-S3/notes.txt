S3

- Object storage. Provides secure, durable, hughly-scalable 

- Simple to use 
- Allows to store and retreive any amount of data 

Manages data as objects rather than in file systems or data blcks. Upload any file type. Photos, videos, code, documents, text files 
Cannot be used to run an OS or DB 

- Unlimited storage. total vol of data and number of objects to store is Unlimited
- Objects can be upto 5TB in size. 0 to 5 TB 
- Files stored in buckets (Folders)

S3 has 
- Universal namepsace. Each s3 bucket name is globally unique 
- S3 urls - https://bucket-name.s3.Region.amazonaws.com/key-name 
- Uploading file - Upon successful upload, will receive a HTTP 200 code 

S3 is a key value store 
key - name of the object 
value - data itself. Sequence of data
version id - storing multiple versions of the same object
metadata - data about data. e.g content-type, last-modified etc.

Data is spread across multiple devices and facilities to ensure availability and durability 

S3 is highly available 
Built for 99.95% and 99.99% service availability depending on s3 tier 
Designed for 99.999999999% durability for data stored in S3 

S3 also is 
- Tieried storage. Offers range of storage classes designed for different use case 
- Lifecycele gmt - Defines rules to automatically transition object to cheaper storage tier or delete objects that are o longer required after set period of time 
- versioning - all version of object are stored and can be retrieved, including deleted objects 

Security 
- Server side encrytipon - Default encryption on bucket 
- ACL (Access COntrol Lists)- Define structure for ACcess and type of access 
- Bucket Policies - Specify which actions you are allowed or denied 

S3 Storage class 

S3 Standard, S3 standard infrequent Access, S3 one zone infrequent access, S3 glacier, s3 glacier deep archive, intelligent tiering

S3 standard 
- High availability and durability.Stored across multiple devices. 
- Designeed for frequent access 
- Suitable for most workloads. use cases -> Websites, content distribution, mobile and gaming apps, big data analytics 

s3 - IA 
- Rapid access but accessed infrequently. 
- You pay to access the data. Low per GB storage price and a per GB retreival fee 
- Long term storage, backups and as a data store for disaster recovery 
- 99.99999999999 (11 9's) durability

s3 one zone ia 
- Data stored redundantly within a single AZ 
- Costs 20% less than regular s3-ia 
- great for long-lived, infrequently accessed, non-critical data 
- 99.99999999999 (11 9's) durability

Glacier
2 glacier options 
- Very cheap storage 
- Very infrequently accessed (3 or 4 time a year)
- Pay each time you access data
- used only for archiving 

Regular glacier 
- long term data archiving. Retrieval time 1 min to 12 hrs. 
- Great for historical data 
-  for quick retreival, pay extra 

Glacier Deep archive 
- archiving rarely accessed data with default retreival time of 12 hours 
- Financial records for access once per year or twice 

S3 intelligent tiering 

- 2 tiers - frequent and infrequent 
automatically moves data to most cost-effective tier based how frequently you access each object 
- optimised cost 
- monthly fee of $0.0025 per 1000 objects
- 99.99999999999 (11 9's) durability

S3 Security 
- Very secure by default 
- By default, all newly created buckets are Private 
- By default only bucket owner can upload new files, read files, delete files etc 
- No public access by default 

Bucket policies 
- Applied at bucket level 
- not individual objects 
- Groups of files 
- Written in json. 

Bucket Access Control Lists 
- Applied at object level 
- Different perms to different objects 
- Which accts or groups are granted access also type of access(read, write , full ctrl)
- Fine grained control 

S3 access logs= log all requests to the s3 bucket 

S3 Types of encryption

a) encryption in transit - SSL/TLS, HTTPS 
b) encryption at rest - server side encryption - SSE-S3 (S3 managed keys using AES256-bit), SSE-KMS (AWS Key mgmt service managed keys), SSE-C (Customer provided keys)
c)  encryption at rest - client side encryption - encryption by client 

Enforcing SSE 
a) Using Console - Set encryption setting on S3 bucket 
b) Bucket Policy - Enforce encryption using bucket policy 
File to be encrypted at upload time, add parameter - x-amz-server-side-encryption

Two options 
x-amz-server-side-encryption - AES256 (SSE s3 managed keys)
x-amz-server-side-encryption: aws:kms (SSE KAMS - KMS managed keys)


When parameter included in header of put request tell S3 on encryption method
