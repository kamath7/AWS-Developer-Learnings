AWS SQS

- One of the oldest services from AWS 
- Message queue service
- Enables web service apps to quickly queue messages that one components generate and anopther consumes 
- temporary repo for messages awaiting processing
- Visibility timeout - time for app server to process the message 
- removes dependencies upon individual components. Decoupling infrastructure 
- Queue resolves issue that arise if procuder is producing work faster than the consumer can process it or if producer or consumer are only intermittently connected to netwrok
- SQS - Pull based not push based, 
- 256 kb in size messages
- text data including xml, json and unformatted text
- guarantess messages will be processed atleast once 
- upto 14 days messages can be kept in queue from one min to 14 days 
- default retention period - 4 days 

SQS queue types 
- 2 types of queues - Standard queue, FIFO queue 
- standard queue - default which provides best-effort ordering 
- fifo - first in first out. order is strictly preserved 

Standard Queue 
- nearly unlimited no of transactions per second
-  guarantess message is delivered atleast once 
- best effort ordering which ensures messages delivered in same order they are sent 

FIFO Queue 
- order in which messages are sent and received strictly preserved
- message is delivered once and remains available until consumer processes and deletes it. duplicates not introduced 
- fifo queues are limited to 300 transactions per second but have all capabilities of standard queues
