AWS CloudWatch 

- Monitoring service to monitor health and performance of aws resources as well as apps that run on AWS and in own datacenter 
- Compute - Can monitor EC2 instances, ASG, ELBs, Lambda, 
- Storage - EBS vols, Storage gateway, CloudFront 
= DBS - DynamoDBS, elasticache , rds, redshit, 
- Others - SNS topics, sqs queues, api gateway

- Cloudwatch agent - can define custom metrics 
- Cloudwatch logs - OS logs and app logs for monitoring 

CloudWatch and EC2 

- All EC2 instances send key health and performance metrics to Cloudwatch 
- Default EC2 host level metrics consist of CPU network, disk and status check 
- Metrics stored indefintely 
- can retrieve data from EC2 or ELB instance even after termination 

OS Level metrics 
- By default no os level metric emitted by EC2 
- Cloudwatch agent can be used to configure 
- OS level metrics - Memeory usage, processes running on instance, amount of free disk space, CPU idle time 

Metric Frequency

- By default, EC2 sends metric data to cloudwatch in 5 min intervals 
- additional charge for 1 min intervals 
- for custom metrics, default is 1 min interval and can configure high res metric at 1 sec intervals 

Monitoring System and App logs 
- Monitor log file and troubleshoot 
- Can customise for custom app 
- Common use case - track no of errors that occur in app log and send notification whenever threshold breached 

Cloudwatch alarms 
- Can create an alarm to monitor any amazon cloudwatch metric in acct 
- can include ec2 cpu utilisation, elb latency or even charges on aws bill 
- threshold - set appropriate thresholds to trigger alarms 
- can send notification or execite auto scaling policy for CPU utilisation > 90% if required

CloudWatch vs Cloudtrail 

Cloudtrail 
- service that records user activity in aws acct 
- cloudtrail records events such as creation, modification, delete of resources such as iam users, s3 buckets
- default - 90 days of acct activity

When to use Cloudwatch and Cloudtrail

CloudWatch
- performance and metrics 
- cloudwatch logs 
- cloudwatch alarms 
CloudTrail 
- used to record all api calls  in aws accts 
- delivers log files containing api call to s3 bucket 
- can be intergated with cloudwatch logs 

Difference 
- is monitoring of aws resources required? then cloudwatch
- is audit log required of aws activity? then cloudtrail
