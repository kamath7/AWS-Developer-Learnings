Relational Databases

RD Basics 
- Relational Databases have been around for many years and are heart of many apps 
- Tables - Data organized into tables 
- Rows - Data items 
- Columns - Fields in the db 


RDS applications - Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) 
RDS Types -  SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Maria DB, Amazon Aurora 

RDS = Up and running in mins . Multi AZ, Failover capability, automated backups

OLTP & Online Analytics Processing (OLAP)

OLTP - rocesses data from transaction in real time e.g. Customer orders, banking transactions, payments and Booking Systems.
OLTP - all about data processing and completing large numbers of small transactions in real-time 

OLAP - Processes complex queries to analyse historical data e.g. analysing net profit figures from past 3 yeas and sales forecasting
OLAP - All about data analysis using large amounts of data, complex queries that take long time to complete

OLAP Example 
- Net profit analysis 
- Large amounts of data (sum of cars sold in each region, unit cost for each region etc)
- Analysis not transactions (RDS not suitable for this type of workload. Data warehouse like Redshift can be used)

RDS - OLTP type workloads 
RDS - not suitable for OLAP
