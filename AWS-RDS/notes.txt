Relational Databases

RD Basics 
- Relational Databases have been around for many years and are heart of many apps 
- Tables - Data organized into tables 
- Rows - Data items 
- Columns - Fields in the db 


RDS applications - Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) 
RDS Types -  SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Maria DB, Amazon Aurora 

RDS = Up and running in mins . Multi AZ, Failover capability, automated backups

OLTP & Online Analytics Processing (OLAP)

OLTP - rocesses data from transaction in real time e.g. Customer orders, banking transactions, payments and Booking Systems.
OLTP - all about data processing and completing large numbers of small transactions in real-time 

Two ways to backup RDS 

a) Database snapshots - Manual, adhoc and user initiated. Snapshot provided, point in time copy 
b) Automated Backups - Enabled by default. Creates daily backups or snapshots that run during backup window that you define. Transaction logs are used to replay transactions

Automated Backups 

a) Point in time recovery. Recover DB at any point within a retention period of 1-35 days
b) Full daily backup. Stores transactions log throughout the day 
c) Recovery Process - AWS will first choose the first backup till the last time 

- Stored in S3. Manual snapshots also in S3 
- Free storage space equal to size of db 
- Defined backup window. During backup window, storage IO will be suspended. increase in latency may be observed 

snapshots-

Not automated
Done manually
No retention period. Not deleted even after original RDS instance are deleted 

snapshots allow to backup to known state 

Restored version of RDS db will be a new RDS instance with a  different endpoint

Encryption at Rest - 
- Can enable Encryption at creation time by selecting Encryption option in console 
- Encryption done using AWS KMS. AES-256 Encryption standard 
- Includes all underlying storage, automated backup, snapshots, logs, read replicas 

Can't enable Encryption on unencrypted RDS DB instance 
Snapshots can help with encrypting an already unencrypted DB .Encrypted snapshot to be performed and Encrypted DB will be prdocued 





OLAP - Processes complex queries to analyse historical data e.g. analysing net profit figures from past 3 yeas and sales forecasting
OLAP - All about data analysis using large amounts of data, complex queries that take long time to complete

OLAP Example 
- Net profit analysis 
- Large amounts of data (sum of cars sold in each region, unit cost for each region etc)
- Analysis not transactions (RDS not suitable for this type of workload. Data warehouse like Redshift can be used)

RDS - OLTP type workloads 
RDS - not suitable for OLAP
