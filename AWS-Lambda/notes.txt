Serverless 

- Allows to run application code in cloud without having to worry about any servers
-AWS handles infra mgmt tasks so that focus is on code 

AWS handles
-  Capacity provisioning
- patching
-auto scaling
- high availability

Competitive advantage
- Speed to market. Release code quickly and release 
- Extremely scalable - scales automatically 
- Lower costs. no overprovisioning
- event drvien . only charge when executed 
- focus on application . instead of configuring infra 


What is Lambda 

- Serverless compute - runs code in aws without provisioning in aws 
- lambda takes care of everything 
- Support for Go, Java, Node js 
- upload code and Go
- Enterrpsie feature auto scaling 

- Charged based numberof requests, duration and amount of memory used by Lambda function 
- Request - first 1 mil reqs per month are free, $0.20 / million reqs after that 
- duration - charged 1 millisecond increments . price depends on amount of memory allocated to lambda func 
- Price per gb-second 

Lambda - event driven architecture 
- Event driven. auto triggerred by other aws services 
- triggerred by events. changes made to data in s3 bucket or dynamodb table 
- triggerred by user reqs. using api gateway to configure http endpoint

AWS Service that invoke lambda  
- dynamodb
0 alexa
- sns 
- sqs 
- cloudformation
- cloudwatch 
- codecommit 
- codepipeline 

API 
- interact with web api. and also apps use to communicate with each other 

API gateway -

Publish , maintain and monitor apis at any scale 
frontdoor for apps to access data, business logic or functionally from backend services
supported api types- restful apis, websocket apis(real time) 

restful apis 
- Optimised for serverless and web apps 
- stateless. nothing held 
- support json 

API gateway provides single endpoint for all client traffic interacting with backend of application

- allows to connect apps to lambda, ec2, elastic beansstalk 
- supports multiple endpoints and targets
- supports multiple version on apis . diff for beta, prod stages 

API gateway 
- serverless 
- integrated with cloudwatch 
- supports throttling. managing traffic thru throttling

Lambda versions 

- When lambda function created, only one version - $LATEST
- When new version of code uploaded, that version will be $LATEST
- Can create multiple versions of function code and user aliases to reference version you want to use as part of arn 
- in dev env , need to maintain few versions of same func as code is developed and tested 
- alias - pointer to specific version of func code 
- if app uses alias , need to update ARN that is being used if new code is to be used
