Serverless 

- Allows to run application code in cloud without having to worry about any servers
-AWS handles infra mgmt tasks so that focus is on code 

AWS handles
-  Capacity provisioning
- patching
-auto scaling
- high availability

Competitive advantage
- Speed to market. Release code quickly and release 
- Extremely scalable - scales automatically 
- Lower costs. no overprovisioning
- event drvien . only charge when executed 
- focus on application . instead of configuring infra 


What is Lambda 

- Serverless compute - runs code in aws without provisioning in aws 
- lambda takes care of everything 
- Support for Go, Java, Node js 
- upload code and Go
- Enterrpsie feature auto scaling 

- Charged based numberof requests, duration and amount of memory used by Lambda function 
- Request - first 1 mil reqs per month are free, $0.20 / million reqs after that 
- duration - charged 1 millisecond increments . price depends on amount of memory allocated to lambda func 
- Price per gb-second 

Lambda - event driven architecture 
- Event driven. auto triggerred by other aws services 
- triggerred by events. changes made to data in s3 bucket or dynamodb table 
- triggerred by user reqs. using api gateway to configure http endpoint
