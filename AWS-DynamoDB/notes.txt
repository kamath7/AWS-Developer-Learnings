Dynamo DB

- Fast and flexible nosql db. consistent, single digit ms latency at any scale 
- Fully managed - supports key-value data models. supported doc formats are json, html and xml 
- Serverless - Integrates well with lambda. Good for Serverless apps 
- Stored on SSD storage. enhances performance 
- Resilience . Spread across 3 geographically distinct data centres 
- Consistency - eventually consistent reads (default). strongly consistent reads 

eventually consistent reads 
- Consistency across all copies of data usually reached within a asecond. best for read performance 

strongly consistent reads 
- reflects all successfull writes. writes are reflected across all 3 locs at once. best for read consistentcy

ACID transactions 
- provide ability to perform ACID (Atomic, consistent, Isolated, Durable)

DynamoDB Primary key
- primary key. stores and retrieves data based on primary key 
- two type. - partition key and composite key (partition key + sort key )

partition key - 
- unique attribute (customer_id ). value of partition key is input to internal hash func which determines the partition or physical loc on which the data is stored .
- if using partition key as primary key, no two keys are allowed the same values 

composite key 
- partition key + sort key 
- partition key not unique in table (e..g forum posts )
- Unique combination - items in table may have same partiriton key but ehy must have different sort key 
- storage - all items with same partition key are stored together and then sorted according to the sort key value .
